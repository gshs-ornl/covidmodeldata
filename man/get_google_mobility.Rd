\description{
This dataset is intended to help remediate the impact of COVID-19. It shouldn’t be used for medical diagnostic,
prognostic, or treatment purposes. It also isn’t intended to be used for guidance on personal travel plans.
Each Community Mobility Report dataset is presented by location and highlights the percent change in visits to
places like grocery stores and parks within a geographic area. Location accuracy and the understanding of categorized
places varies from region to region, so we don’t recommend using this data to compare changes between countries, or
between regions with different characteristics (e.g. rural versus urban areas). We’ll leave a region or category out
of the dataset if we don’t have sufficient statistically significant levels of data.
}
\details{
These datasets show how visits and length of stay at different places change compared to a baseline.
We calculate these changes using the same kind of aggregated and anonymized data used to show popular
times for places in Google Maps.

Changes for each day are compared to a baseline value for that day of the week:
\itemize{
\item The baseline is the median value, for the corresponding day of the week, during the 5-week period Jan 3–Feb 6, 2020.
\item The datasets show trends over several months with the most recent data representing approximately 2-3 days ago
this is how long it takes to produce the datasets.

What data is included in the calculation depends on user settings, connectivity, and whether it meets our privacy threshold.
If the privacy threshold isn’t met (when somewhere isn’t busy enough to ensure anonymity) we don’t show a change for the day.
As a result, you may encounter empty fields for certain places and dates. We include categories that are useful to social distancing
efforts as well as access to essential services. We calculate these insights based on data from users who have opted-in to Location History
for their Google Account, so the data represents a sample of our users. As with all samples, this may or may not represent the exact behavior
of a wider population.
